# Bank System

## Overview
This is a simple banking system written in Java that simulates various banking operations. It allows users to create savings and business accounts, deposit, withdraw, transfer funds between accounts, and more. The system tracks account balances and allows for additional operations like applying interest to savings accounts and reviewing transaction histories for business accounts.
